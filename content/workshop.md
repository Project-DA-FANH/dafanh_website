## Summer 2022 Workshops

The workshops teach foundational skills to work effectively and reproducibly with data and code. The curriculum will include:

* Organizing data in spreadsheets
* Data Management in R
* Data Visualization
* Creating reproducible documents using Markdown.

The target audience is learners who have little to no prior computational experience but want to learn how to use data to support their science. The instructors prioritize creating a friendly environment for learning to empower researchers and enable data driven discovery

These workshops are _free_ to anyone involved in the summer research programs (such as  $CSC^2$ or Adelante at Chico State)
