## Summer 2022 Workshops

The workshops teach foundational skills to work effectively and reproducibly with data and code. The curriculum will include:

* **Day 1: Half day**
    * File naming and organizational practices for the modern scientist
    * Organizing data in spreadsheets for computers, not humans
* **Day 2: Full day**
  * Data Management in R and R Studio
  * Ensuring reproducible analysis using Markdown.
  * Data Visualization
  

The target audience are learners who have little to no prior computational experience but want to learn how to use data to support their science. The instructors prioritize creating a friendly environment for learning to empower researchers and enable data driven discovery

These workshops are _free_ to anyone involved in the summer research programs (such as CSC2 or Adelante at Chico State)
