# June 2022 - For Undergraduate & Graduate Summer Researchers

The target audience are learners who have little to no prior computational experience but want to learn how to use data to support their science. The instructors prioritize creating a friendly environment for learning to empower researchers and enable data driven discovery

These workshops are _free_ to anyone involved in the summer research programs (such as CSC2 or Adelante at Chico State)

The 1.5 day curriculum will include:


* **Day 1: Half day**
  * File naming and organizational practices for the modern scientist
  * Organizing data in spreadsheets for computers, not humans
* **Day 2: Full day**
  * Data Management in R and R Studio
  * Ensuring reproducible analysis using Markdown.
  * Data Visualization
  
Refreshments will be provided throughout the day on Day 2.
