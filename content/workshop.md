[The Carpentries](https://carpentries.org/) is a non-profit organization that teaches foundational coding and data science skills to researchers worldwide. Project DA-FANH is proud to have 3 certified [Carpentry instructors](https://carpentries.org/instructors/) and 4 more in training. We offer the following three lesson programs:

* [Software Carpentry](https://software-carpentry.org) teaches researchers the computing skills they need to get more done in less time and with less pain. These workshops teach three core topics: the Unix shell, version control with Git, and a programming language (Python or R).
* [Data Carpentry](https://datacarpentry.org/) teaches the introductory computational skills needed for data management and analysis in all domains of research. These lessons are domain-specific, and build on the existing knowledge of learners to enable them to quickly apply skills learned to their own research.
* [Library Carpentry](https://librarycarpentry.org/) teach software and data skills for people working in library and information-related roles. Our shared goal is to empower people to use software and data in their own work and to become advocates for and train others in efficient, effective and reproducible data and software practices.


Our initial target audience is learners who have little to no prior computational experience. We create a friendly environment for learning to empower researchers and enable data driven discovery.
