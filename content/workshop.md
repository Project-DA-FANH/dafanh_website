# June 2022 - Summer undergraduate & graduate research participants

The target audience are learners who have little to no prior computational experience but want to learn how to use data to support their science. The instructors prioritize creating a friendly environment for learning to empower researchers and enable data driven discovery

The 1.5 day curriculum will include:


* **Day 1: Half day**
  * File naming and organizational practices for the modern scientist
  * Organizing data in spreadsheets for computers, not humans
* **Day 2: Full day**
