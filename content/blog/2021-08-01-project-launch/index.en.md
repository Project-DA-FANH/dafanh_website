# How two institutions partnered to enhance the quality of undergraduate education for Hispanic students
                                  
**CHICO, C.A.** - CSU Chico and CSU San Bernardino are two Hispanic Serving Institutions in the California State University system. These universities are collaborating to enhance the quality of college education at the intersection of Data Science and Analytics (DS/DA) and the Food, Agriculture, Natural resources and Human sciences (FANH).

The launch of Project DA-FANH will help assist and enhance the quality of postsecondary education by fostering an active, inclusive and diverse community of individuals who utilize DS/DA for FANH careers, research and program dissemination. The primary goal of this project is to retain and graduate highly qualified students. These students are capable of enhancing the nationâ€™s food, agriculture, natural resources along with the human science professional and scientific workforce.

DA-FANH is directed by Dr. Robin Donatello (Chico) and Dr. Essia Hamouda (San Bernardino) and is supported by many other influential and successful women. This partnership ignited a project that launched in August 2021 and is finally being released February 21, 2022.

The launch focuses specifically on highlighting the program and what it entails. Project activities  include career panels and job assistance that will provide students access to career opportunities.  The project also offers authentic internship experiences that emphasize problem solving, data-driven decision-making and remote team collaboration skills. 

A faculty learning community is key for this project to integrate DS/DA skills into curriculum that support FANH programs, increasing interest and aptitude among faculty and students. By enfusing culturally relevant pedagogy and modeling incorporation of Data Science and Analytics techniques in the FANH curriculum, this project aims to dismantle barriers and existing stereotypes about who belongs and builds a pathway for Students of Color in the intersection of DS/DA and FANH careers.


This newly released project website will continue to evolve with the growth and development of Project DA-FANH. All news, activities and latest updates will be accessible through this site, along with social media links and scholarship opportunities.
