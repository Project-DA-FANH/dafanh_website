**Desiree Orozco**, a Chico State undergraduate student, participated in one of Project DA-FANH's Data Skills Workshops. Below is her reflection on the skills she gained from the experience:


> *"The DA-FANH Data Skill Workshop helped me in many ways. To begin, I had no idea the data science community existed until I took this two-day workshop. I attended with zero knowledge of coding and some knowledge of Excel. During this course Dr. Robin touched base on some handy skills in Excel which I continue to use during my research, Dr. Robin also taught me the basics of R studio which I am now using to construct graphs from data collected during my summer research. As an animal science major, it becomes exceedingly difficult to find agricultural classes that teach data handling and technology use. This workshop has surely helped me in my academic career, since taking this workshop I have had other research opportunities offered and have improved in my research homework for classes. I would recommend for any student that is interested in doing research or is in a stem career to take this data skill workshop since I have found it immensely helpful."*

If you want to gain skills in data analysis and learn how to use tools like Excel and R Studio to advance your research, check out the Data Science communities at [CSU Chico](https://datascience.csuchico.edu/), or [CSU San Bernardino](https://www.csusb.edu/data-analytics-working-group).
