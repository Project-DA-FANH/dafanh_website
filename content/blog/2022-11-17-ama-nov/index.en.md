Are you interested in careers that use data to make informed decisions in the Food, Agriculture, Natural Resources or Human sciences? Do you want to know how professionals landed their career or what they wished they did during college? Our monthly "Ask me Anything" speaker series continues with Natalia CaÃ±as. Come ask Natalia about her journey to become a Research and Policy Associate at the National Alliance for Hispanic Health and learn how she uses research and data to understand the impact of COVID-19 on the Hispanic community.
