This month's "Ask me Anything" speaker is the amazing Dr. Sara Bleich, the Director of Nutrition Security and Health Equity in the Food and Nutrition Service at the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA). 

This is not the only data driven career experience Dr. Bleich has! Come and ask her questions about her experience as the Senior Advisor for COVID-19 in the Office of the Secretary at USDA, or as a Senior Policy Adviser for Food, Nutrition and Consumer Services and with the First Lady Michelle Obama’s Let’s Move! Initiative, or as a Professor of Public Health Policy at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health.
