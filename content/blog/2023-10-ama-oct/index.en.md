Come and ask her questions about her experience as the Senior Advisor for COVID-19 in the Office of the Secretary at USDA, or as a Senior Policy Adviser for Food, Nutrition and Consumer Services and with the First Lady Michelle Obama’s Let’s Move! Initiative, or as a Professor of Public Health Policy at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health.
