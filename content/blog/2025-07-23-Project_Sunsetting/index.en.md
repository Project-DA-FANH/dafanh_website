Project DA-FANH was funded by a USDA HSI Education Grant from Aug 2021 to July 2025. This project helped enriching education at the intersection of Data Analytics and the food, agriculture, natural resources and human sciences domains through professional experiential learning and curriculum development. 
 
Some activities developed by the grant such as the professional internship at Chico State, and weekly data analytic virtual workshops at CSUSB https://www.csusb.edu/data-analytics-working-group/workshops have been institutionalized and continue to serve their students. 

Our YouTube page will remain active at https://youtube.com/@calstate_dafanh?si=IlV0OaGwsQzAotke - containing clips from and full recordings of many AMA's and our Career Panels, as well as two full recordings from multiple day R and Python workshops.

To get involved and stay up to date with any future activities, please see Chico State's Data Science Initiative webpage at https://datascience.csuchico.edu/ or CSU San Bernardo's Data Analytics Working Group page at https://www.csusb.edu/data-analytics-working-group/about

We thank all of our prior interns, project partners including the Center for Healthy Communities (CHC), the Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation, Center for Regenerative Agriculture, Institutional Research and Strategic Analytics, and the XReal lab and collaborative/supportive staff at CHC. We couldn't have done it without you! We value your partnerships and time and look forward to our continued collaborations. 

Sincerely,
