# Spring 2023 Career Panel

The Spring 2023 Career Panel happened late in March and we had a great time meeting with four data science professionals and learning all about their careers. Our students had a lot of great questions to ask, and the career professionals were able to provide some amazing answers and helped to educate the students on what a career in data looks like. We are already getting excited for our second career panel that will happen next spring!

Video highlights are coming soon, so stay posted!
