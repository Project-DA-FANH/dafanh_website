## Our goals

Enhance the quality of postsecondary education, which will retain and graduate highly qualified students capable of enhancing the nationâ€™s food, agriculture, natural resources and humans sciences (FANH) professional and scientific work force. The project objectives include:

  * Career panels and job talks providing students opportunities for direct access to careers at the intersection of FANH and Data Science (DS). 
  * An Experiential Learning program to further student scientific and professional competencies. Authentic internship experiences emphasize problem solving, decision-making and 
remote team collaboration skills. 
  * A Faculty learning community to integrate DS skills into curriculum that support FANH programs and to increase interest and 
aptitude among faculty and students. Promoting culturally relevant pedagogy and modeling incorporation of DS technologies in the FANH curriculum will dismantle 
existing stereotypes about who belongs and build a pathway for Students of Color in DS and FANH careers. 
  * Foster an active, inclusive and diverse community of 
individuals who utilize DS for FANH careers, research and program dissemination.
