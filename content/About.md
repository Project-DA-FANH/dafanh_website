title: "About Project DA-FANH"
---


Project DA-FANH, launched in August 2021 and was officially released February 21, 2022 by directors Dr. Robin Donatello (Chico State) and Dr. Essia Hamouda (Cal State San Bernardino) along with the help of other influential and successful women. 

Our primary goal is to retain and graduate highly qualified students while dismantling barriers and existing stereotypes. We aim to build a pathway for students of color in the intersection of Data Science/Data Analytics within food, agriculture, natural resources and human sciences (FANH) careers. DA-FANH assists underrepresented students at Chico State and Cal State San Bernardino while allowing for increased representation in fields that are traditionally lacking in diversity. 

This program focuses on teaching students how to enhance the nation’s career fields in food, agriculture, natural resources, and the human science professional and scientific workforce. We are assisting students in growing their future and increasing opportunities in the work force one day at a time. You can find us on your campuses at Holt 202 (Dr. Donatello) and JB-525 (Dr. Hamouda). 



## Our goals

Enhance the quality of postsecondary education, which will retain and graduate highly qualified students capable of enhancing the nation’s food, agriculture, natural resources and humans sciences (FANH) professional and scientific work force. The project objectives include:

  * Career panels and job talks providing students opportunities for direct access to careers at the intersection of FANH and Data Science (DS). 
  * An Experiential Learning program to further student scientific and professional competencies. Authentic internship experiences emphasize problem solving, decision-making and 
remote team collaboration skills. 
  * A Faculty learning community to integrate DS skills into curriculum that support FANH programs and to increase interest and 
aptitude among faculty and students. Promoting culturally relevant pedagogy and modeling incorporation of DS technologies in the FANH curriculum will dismantle 
existing stereotypes about who belongs and build a pathway for Students of Color in DS and FANH careers. 
  * Foster an active, inclusive and diverse community of 
individuals who utilize DS for FANH careers, research and program dissemination.
