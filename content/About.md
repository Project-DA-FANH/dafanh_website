## Enriching Education at the Intersection of Data Analytics and FANH through Professional and Experiential Learning and Curriculum Development 
### (Project DA-FAN)

* **Fund**: This project is funded by a 4-year, $275 thousand dollar grant from the USDA NIFA Hispanic Serving Institutions Education Grant. 

* **Collaborators**: CSU Chico and CSU San Bernardino, two HSI colleges in the California 
State University system, together are working to enhance the quality of college education at the intersection between Data Science and the Food, Agriculture, Natural resources and Human sciences. 

* **Objective**: Enhance the quality of postsecondary education, which will retain and graduate highly qualified students capable of enhancing the nationâ€™s food, agriculture, natural resources and humans sciences (FANH) professional and scientific work force. The project objectives include:
  * Career panels and job talks providing students opportunities for direct access to careers at the intersection of FANH and Data Science (DS). 
  * An Experiential Learning program to further student scientific and professional competencies. Authentic internship experiences emphasize problem solving, decision-making and 
remote team collaboration skills. 
  * A Faculty learning community to integrate DS skills into curriculum that support FANH programs and to increase interest and 
aptitude among faculty and students. Promoting culturally relevant pedagogy and modeling incorporation of DS technologies in the FANH curriculum will dismantle 
existing stereotypes about who belongs and build a pathway for Students of Color in DS and FANH careers. 
  * Foster an active, inclusive and diverse community of 
individuals who utilize DS for FANH careers, research and program dissemination.

* **Evaluation**: This project will be continuously evaluated and its accomplishments (i.e. products, 
impacts, research) shared with the academic community through presentations and publications. 

* **Impact**: Program materials developed from this project will benefit approximately 
90 faculty, 80 graduate and 800 undergraduate students, and 100 professionals working on current state-wide USDA grants. 
* **Benefits**: will be used to increase future 
grant proposal competitiveness, and strengthen statewide campus collaborations, potentially leading to multi-institution online degree programs.
