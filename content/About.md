Project DA-FANH, launched in August 2021 and was officially released February 21, 2022 by directors Dr. Robin Donatello (Chico State) and Dr. Essia Hamouda (Cal State San Bernardino), in collaboration with a team of accomplished professionals.

Our primary goal is to support student achievement and increase graduation rates by expanding access to opportunities and academic development. We aim to create a clear pathway into careers at the intersection of Data Science and Data Analytics within food, agriculture, natural resources, and human sciences (FANH).

This project works with students at Chico State and Cal State San Bernardino to help them build skills, strengthen career preparation, and explore FANH-related professions that benefit from broader participation. We focus on equipping students with tools to contribute meaningfully to the nation’s professional and scientific workforce in FANH-related sectors. We’re here to support students in shaping their futures and building long-term career success. 



## Our goals

Enhance the quality of postsecondary education, which will retain and graduate highly qualified students capable of enhancing the nation’s food, agriculture, natural resources and humans sciences (FANH) professional and scientific work force. The project objectives include:

* Career panels and job talks providing students opportunities for direct access to careers at the intersection of FANH and Data Science (DS).
* An Experiential Learning program to further student scientific and professional competencies. Authentic internship experiences emphasize problem solving, decision-making and remote team collaboration skills.
* A Faculty learning community to integrate DS skills into curriculum that support FANH programs and to increase interest and aptitude among faculty and students. The program models incorporation of DS technologies in the FANH curriculum and aims to broaden participation in DS and FANH careers.
* Foster an active community of individuals who utilize DS for FANH careers, research and program dissemination.
