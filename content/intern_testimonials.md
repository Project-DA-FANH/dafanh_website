“There’s nothing better than having a supervisor that communicative and easy to reach. I really enjoyed working with them because they were always encouraging.The whole point of the internship was to learn something new, develop a new skill or expand your knowledge. No matter how silly of a question you had, you will get at least some type of answer. There was only room for success in this internship if you tried and my supervisor did an amazing job reminding us of that.” 

“Before starting the internship, my knowledge with data analysis was at zero. But now after completing the internship and learning a programming language to make sense of it all, has helped me develop a new skill that will help expand my professional network depending on what I want to do with my career.” 

“What I liked most was getting to learn a whole new world of data science and learning R. It has made me have a new found love for statistics and having this as a possible career.” 
 
"What I liked most was being able to have someone who was patient in me learning R and answering my questions"

"This internship expanded my network in a whole different area that I could not have in my school program."

"I really enjoyed being able develop a skill that I never imagined myself doing before. I came into this internship with zero knowledge with programming languages and being able to use R to create something so simple brings so much excitement."
