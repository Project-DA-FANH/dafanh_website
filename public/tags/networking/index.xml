      <description>&lt;p&gt;While in college, networking is extremely valuable when trying to navigate life post-graduation. Networking allows leaders and peers in specific fields to give students tips, advices and knowledge about the various paths they can take to become established and successful.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Networking begins communication with other professionals by putting a face to your name. Short conversations can promote long-term discussions regarding potential jobs or introduce fields related to your interests. This new knowledge can help direct future graduates in a better direction when applying for entry-level jobs or choosing internships that will allow them to gain work experience.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
