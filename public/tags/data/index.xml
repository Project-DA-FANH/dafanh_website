      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;chico-state-data-fest-2022-recap&#34;&gt;Chico State Data Fest 2022 Recap&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;On April 1-3rd, Chico State University hosted the ASA DataFest 2022. DataFest is an event hosted by the Chico State Data Initiative (DSI), organized by the Mathematics &amp;amp; Statistics department and Project DA-FANH&amp;rsquo;s project director Robin Donatello. Students were presented with undisclosed data on Friday and then worked through the weekend to gain the best insights into the confidential, real-world data sets. After long nights and early mornings, teams presented their findings to the experienced panel of judges for a chance at prizes and certificates. The event is part of the universityâ€™s efforts to provide training, expand collaboration and encourage new research in the field of Data Science and Data Analytics.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
