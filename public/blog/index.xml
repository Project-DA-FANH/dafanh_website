      <description>We are excited for the kickoff of our workshop series. Our first and upcoming workshop will be on January 13th - 14th, 2022 and hope you are too. A few notes:
 Be sure to complete the pre-workshop survey. We use this to calibrate the pace of the workshop and, together with a post-workshop survey, to assess how it went.
 Make sure you have the necessary software installed on your laptop: R, R Studio, git, and Nano.</description>
